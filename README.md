<h5>Introduction to Serialization and Deserialization</h5>
<p>Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can be easily saved to a file or transmitted over a network. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is converted back into a copy of the object. This mechanism allows for the persistent storage and transfer of objects between different systems.</p>

<h5>Benefits of Serialization and Deserialization</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Persistence</strong>: Objects can be saved to files or databases, allowing data to persist between program executions.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication</strong>: Objects can be transmitted over a network, facilitating distributed computing.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Copy</strong>: Creating a deep copy of an object by serializing and then deserializing it.</li>
            <li><strong>Caching</strong>: Serialized objects can be cached and reused, improving performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplified Data Storage</strong>: Storing complex data structures in a flat file format.</li>
        </ul>

<h5>Mechanism of Serialization and Deserialization</h5>
<p>In Java, an object is serialized by converting it into a byte stream using classes like <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>FileOutputStream</code>. This byte stream can be written to a file or sent over a network. To deserialize, the byte stream is read using <code>ObjectInputStream</code> and <code>FileInputStream</code>, reconstructing the original object.</p>

<h5>Example Code Snippet</h5>
<p>Let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we have an <code>Employee</code> class, and we want to serialize an object of this class to a file and then deserialize it back to an object.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h6>"Employee.java"</h6>
<p>Defines an <code>Employee</code> class that implements <code>Serializable</code>.</p>
<p>Contains fields for <code>Name</code>, <code>address</code>, and <code>age</code>.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h6>"ReadFile.java"</h6>
<p>Deserializes the <code>employee.ser</code> file back into an <code>Employee</code> object using <code>ObjectInputStream</code> and <code>FileInputStream</code>.</p>
<p>Prints the deserialized object to verify the process.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h6>"WriteFile.java"</h6>
<p>Creates an <code>Employee</code> object.</p>
<p>Serializes this object to a file named <code>employee.ser</code> using <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>FileOutputStream</code>.</p>
